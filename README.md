<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="readme_files/cover.png" alt="Cover Image">

* Project Name: IT MOM Alarms and Calls Dashboard
* Version: v1.0.0
* Organization Department: Technology


### Business Case
The "IT MOM Alarms Automation" project is a strategic 
initiative by IT Automation to enhance the reliability of 
critical IT systems. 

In a rapidly changing tech landscape, 
downtime can harm customer satisfaction and business 
performance. To tackle this, the MOM Alarms Automation 
project streamlines the handling of vital IT alarms.

The project's core goal is quick identification and 
resolution of critical alarms, bolstering efficiency and 
customer satisfaction. Real-time notifications empower 
IT teams to promptly respond to alarms, minimizing 
disruptions. 

Automated alerts to on-call team members reduce response 
times, minimizing system downtime risks.

The IT MOM Alarms and Calls Dashboard is a pivotal part of 
this initiative. It offers a holistic view of application 
health, revealing alarm patterns, call responses, and 
team performance. Key metrics, including received alarms, 
initiated calls, and call outcomes, empower decision-makers. 

Graphical displays aid in understanding system behavior 
and support proactive actions.
